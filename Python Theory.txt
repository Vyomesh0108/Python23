-> Python was developed in 1991 by "GUIDO VAN ROSSUM".
-> Python was designed to run in wide variety environment.
-> Using python we can create console application, web application, machine learning, Handle data science, Etc.

* List '[]'
-> List in python can be declared with box bracket '[]'.
-> List is a group of any type of multiple data.
-> List is mutable that is value of it can be changed at any level of program.

* Tuple '()'
-> Tuple is an immutable datatype in python, almost like list. But value of tuple cannot be modified.

* Difference between list and tuple:

	List:-
	-> Used for homogeneous data type.
	-> It is Mutable in behavior. Means it can be changed.
	-> It is little slower.
	-> It is not secured.

	Tuple:- 
	-> Used for heterogeneous data type.
	-> It is immutable in behavior. Means it cannot be changed.
	-> It is faster.
	-> It is secured. 

* Set '{}'
-> It is a collection of unordered elements.
-> It can be of any type and it is mutable also, but it cannot have repeated values.

* Dictionary
-> It is a collection of Key and value.
-> It is unordered and mutable.
-> Dictionary must be unique so, it can be used index to access value.

* Difference between list and dictionary:

	List:-
	-> It is ordered. 
	-> It is using index to access value.	
	-> It is collection of values only.
	-> It allows duplicate members.

	Dictionary:-
	-> It is unordered.
	-> It is using key to access value.
	-> It is collection of key value pair.
	-> It doesn't allow duplicate members.
